Web Secretary is a web page monitoring software. However, it goes beyond the normal
functionalities offered by such software. It will detect changes based on content
analysis, making sure that it's not just HTML that changed, but actual content.
You can tell it what to ignore in the page (hit counters and such), and it can
mail you the document with the changes highlighted or load the highlighted page
in a browser.

Web Secretary is actually a suite of two Perl scripts called websec and webdiff.
websec retrieves web pages and email them to you based on a URL list that you
provide. webdiff compares two web pages (current and archive) and creates a new
page based on the current page but with all the differences highlighted using a
predefined color.
